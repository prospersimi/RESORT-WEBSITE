    <h2>BENEFITS OF HAVING PETS.</h2>
    <p>With almost no effort at all, pets manage to bring so much joy into our lives. They make us laugh, comfort us
        when we’re sick or upset, and are always there for us no matter what. It’s no wonder that an estimated 12
        million British households choose to keep a pet.</p>
    <p>Not everyone understands the bond between human and beast, though, or even realises how much pets do for their
        owners. We take a look at ten of the benefits of having a furry friend.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>They keep you fit:
            <p>All breeds of dog need regular, daily walks in order to stay happy and healthy, and so do we! However, we
                sometimes have the tendency to get a bit lazy – if that sounds like you, a dog is the perfect cure!
                They’ll be dragging you out the front door and making you run around the park each and every day. Yes, a
                dog is possibly the best personal trainer you could ask for.</p>
        </li>

        <li>They make sure you’re never lonely:
            <p>If you live by yourself, or your partner works different shift patterns to you, it can get awfully lonely
                at home – unless you have a pet, of course! Cats and dogs make great companions – they’ll always be
                waiting for you to come home and they’ll be happy to lend an ear should you want to moan about the awful
                day you’ve had. Plus, most of the time, they’re up for a snuggle on the sofa.</p>
        </li>

        <li>They lower your stress levels:
            <p>Modern life is stressful and high levels of anxiety can lead to numerous health problems. Luckily, pets
                can really help us relax – stroking your cat or simply watching fish swim around in a tank can make your
                worries melt away. Previous studies have proven that pet owners tend to have lower blood pressure,
                cholesterol and triglyceride levels than people who don’t own a pet. That means having a furry pal can
                decrease the chances of suffering a heart attack later in life.</p>
        </li>

        <li>They can help you make friends:
            <p>The pet owner community is an incredibly friendly one – you’ll often find that people will stop to talk
                to you about your dog in the park. Having a pet is a great way to meet new people and create bonds
                quickly, especially if you’re not too good at small talk. You never know, owning a dog may help you meet
                the love of your life!</p>
        </li>

        <li>They can improve your immune system:
            <p>Pets spend a lot of their time outside and therefore bring all sorts of dirt and germs into your home.
                This isn’t necessarily a bad thing though – the additional germs can help improve your immunity to colds
                and other mild illnesses. In fact, previous studies have shown that babies who live with a dog tend to
                experience fewer infections and are generally healthier than those who don’t.</p>
        </li>
        <img src="images/no3cd.jpg"alt="picture of a cat and dog">
        <li>They can stop your children from developing allergies:
            <p>While it’s no guarantee that owning a pet will stop your children from developing certain allergies, the
                evidence suggests the dander in their fur may help. However, it’s worth noting that you should never own
                a cat or dog if you are allergic to them – you won’t suddenly become immune!</p>
        </li>

        <li>They can catch cancer early:
            <p>It’s no secret that a dogs’ sense of smell is incredible, but did you know that some canines are capable
                of detecting cancer? Several pet owners have reported that their dog saved their lives after they
                noticed they were constantly pawing at, sniffing or even licking a tumour hidden underneath the skin.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>They can teach kids responsibility:
            <p>Every parent has heard the question ‘Can I have a pony/puppy/hamster?’ at some point in their child’s
                life. It’s no secret that kids love animals, and if they’re old enough, having one as a pet can actually
                teach them a lot of important skills. Not only will they learn the practical skills required to own a
                pet, such as cleaning out the cage, grooming and teaching tricks; they’ll also develop their nurturing
                and empathy skills, which are vital in later life.</p>
        </li>

        <li>They make you feel safe:
            <p>Not everyone likes being home alone, but having a cat or dog there can make you feel a lot safer. Plus,
                burglars are less likely to target a house that’s clearly home to a dog. Some breeds make excellent
                guard dogs and will even protect you when you’re out for a run or walk.</p>
        </li>

        <li>They can provide companionship to children with learning difficulties:
            <p>Children with autism and similar learning disorders often find it difficult talking to fellow human
                beings, but they have no problem at all with chatting away to friendly animals. After all, your pets
                can’t answer back and will always keep your secrets!
                Looking after a pet is a big responsibility, but when you consider all the benefits above, they make all
                that hard work worthwhile. Whether you choose to keep a cat, dog, horse or hamster, they’ll make a great
                company.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
